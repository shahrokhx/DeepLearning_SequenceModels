# DeepLearning_SequenceModels
A collection of step-by-step deep learning solutions for sequence modeling and time series analysis tasks.

----

These are part of the projects that I have worked on during the Deep Learning and TensorFlow courses, including the **Deep Learning Specialization** courses and **Tensorflow Advanced Developer** courses on Coursera which are offered by **Deeplearning.ai**. I will also gradually add the rest of the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) applications for modeling and analysis sequential and temporal data that I have accomplished during my studies and PhD research to this repository.
